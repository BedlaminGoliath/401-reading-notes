What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
I myself am very tenacious and I know That consistency is key. Software development is the hardest thing that I have taken on and it is something that, has NOT come natural to me so needless to say, I have spent ALOT of time really working at this. The things I love most in this life has been skateboarding and music. From both I have taken some amazing lessons… In the world of skateboarding you learn to love to fall, usually falling means you committed to trying the trick and even though you didnt make it the first try (sometimes you do) It means that you “went for it” and now you have a clearer idea of what it will take to roll away from that trick. Another great lesson from skateboarding is if you keep trying a trick the same way you will often get the same result, therefore you need to make small adjustments to ensure that you are gonna get closer to landing said trick. The other activity that I will also forever love Is music…I grew up a drummer/ guitar player and Thee activities are very much so “life long pursuits” there is no “end” you will likely spend the rest of your life “woodshedding” (Bettering yourself) and constantly fine tuning your craft, some musicians will play what is easy and thats cool but I have always strived to get better and work on those pieces that are a challenge so I can level up.

 What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

 I will Stop and make sure that I have a clear understanding of the problem domain… write it or even simplify it even more if possible.
 Take a 15 minute break (if im really stuck…. Sometimes stepping away helps)
 Comments! And “5Y” method seems to be pretty awesome.

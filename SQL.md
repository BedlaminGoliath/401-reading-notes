# SQL notes

Through out the study of SQL and the commands I noticed the simplicity of the "language" partially do to my time I have spent working in JS. Everything seems to be very "intiuative" and the use of "arguement" and how we are using conditionals in order to really dail in the specific item we are trying to reach. The order of the commands also seems to make alot of sense and somewhat feels "single threaded" as well. This feels very synchronus and allows me to easily what is happening "line by line", even though it is going vertically. I am able to see what is happening.

I really want to get a better understanding as to how we are going to apply this to our current use in the JS realm. From my brief using DB's and parsing through that data, I would like to see the effiency. I know we havent touched much on "Big O notation" but i am curious to see if this plays a role in how our app runs (I understand fundamentally it can effect the time based on the size of the query, but I want to know HOW MUCH BETTER this can make our querys).

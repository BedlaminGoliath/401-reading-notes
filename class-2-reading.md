## Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter

Middlewear is like the crossing guard or the guy who directs traffic when a light is out. He stands in the street and he calls for some cars to drive across the street and when they finish driving by he calls the next round. The standard flow of track is continouse however there is a break because he (or she) is there to be a middle man and allow who ever needs to cross, to actually cross (safely).

## Express the most popular ________

Web Franeme Work

## Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

This meand that there is many different ways to solve problems or to piece together components to solve said problem. The means that it is alittle more flexible to handle a speicific problem based on the situation.

## What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

Modules allows us to import those modules (using `require()`) into other code that allows us to keep our code clean and allows use to consider the "single function" concept which means that we can create different modules to to specific tests.... Meaning that we would allow access to different properties and functions (from other files).

## What version of npm are you running on your machine?

node v19.1.0

## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

`npm install jshint`

## Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder

Tests allows you to make sure that your code is working properly. This is great because besides the fact that your code would work but with the idea of writing your test **first** then writing you simplest code to make the test to pass **then** you can refactor that code to make sure it fits. This assures that your code leaves he testing in the beginning where your foundation is solid, there for you can build and have a solid structure to build on top of.

## What are three expected benefits of testing

- there is less defected areas in the code.

- keeps from the final phase of development, becoming an "s" show, since we are taking care of the quality consistantly.

- Some Seasoned devs say that this helps the overall quality(design) of the project... which makes sense, since the tests are helping you out in the beginning, leaving the design some room to breath.

## Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests

- writing trivial tests.

- forgetting to test frequently.

## What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

lessens merge conflicts

catches bugs

maintains high quality of project

## What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

**continous delivery** can be developed at any time. the quality is there.

**continous deployment** This allows us to constantly to deploy "new features"

## Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

Git hub allows us to make sure the people who needs to know about our tests and even give more info to those about, this lets everyone know if everything is okay to intigrate. This feels like a bouncer at a club, where git hub makes sure we get green light for certain people and even fill us in on why certain people arent allowed "in".
